Introduction Level-Up Developer built the Cardify app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by Level-Up Developer at no cost and is intended for use as is. This policy helps you understand what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding your data.

By using Cardify, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy. We use your Personal Information to provide the flashcard service, sync your progress, and improve the app's performance. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.

Information Collection and Use To provide a personalized learning experience and allow you to sync your flashcards across devices, we require certain personally identifiable information:

Account Information: When you register, we collect your First Name, Last Name, and Email Address.

User-Generated Content: We store the text and images you upload to your collections and flashcards so that they are available for your study sessions.

App Usage Data: We collect data regarding your review ratings (Easy, Medium, Hard, Again) to power the spaced-repetition algorithm that schedules your next review.

Third-Party Services The app utilizes third-party services that may collect information used to identify you. These may include:

Google Play Services

Google Analytics for Firebase (to monitor app performance)

Firebase Authentication (to manage your secure sign-in)

Cookies Cookies are files with a small amount of data used as anonymous unique identifiers. Cardify does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party libraries (like Firebase) that use cookies to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to manage these via your device settings.

Device Information We may collect information about the device you use to access the Service, including the hardware model and operating system version. This is used solely to optimize app performance and prevent fraudulent activity.

Service Providers We may employ third-party companies (such as cloud hosting and database providers) to:

Facilitate our Service (e.g., storing your flashcards in the cloud);

Assist us in analyzing how our Service is used. These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.

Security We value your trust. We use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal data and flashcard content. However, remember that no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee its absolute security.

Children’s Privacy Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal identifiable information from children under 13. If we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete it from our servers.
